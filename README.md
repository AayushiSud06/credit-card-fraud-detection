# 🛡️ AI FraudShield

An Explainable Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard built using Machine Learning, SHAP Explainability, and Streamlit.

## 📌 Overview

Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses every year. Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately while minimizing false alarms is a major challenge for financial institutions.

AI FraudShield is an end-to-end machine learning solution that analyzes transaction data, predicts fraudulent activity, assigns risk levels, and provides visual explanations through an interactive dashboard.

## Key Highlights

- Built an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline
- Implemented SHAP-based Explainable AI for model transparency
- Developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Generated fraud probability scores and risk levels
- Enabled CSV-based transaction analysis and reporting

## 🚀 Features

* Credit card fraud detection using Random Forest
* Fraud probability scoring
* Risk level categorization (Low, Medium, High)
* Interactive Streamlit dashboard
* CSV transaction upload
* Downloadable analysis reports
* Feature Importance Analysis
* SHAP Explainability

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset containing anonymized transaction features:

* Time
* Amount
* V1–V28 anonymized PCA-transformed features
* Class (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

The dataset is highly imbalanced, making fraud detection a challenging classification problem.

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

## 🤖 Models Used

### Logistic Regression

Used as a baseline model for comparison.

### Random Forest Classifier

Selected as the final model due to its strong fraud detection performance, high precision, and ability to provide feature importance insights.
---

## 📈 Model Performance

### Random Forest

* Precision: 1.00
* Recall: 0.73
* F1-Score: 0.85

The model achieved strong fraud detection performance while maintaining high precision and interpretability.

## 🧠 Explainable AI

To improve transparency and trust in predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used.

Key insights:

* V14 was the most influential feature
* V17, V12, and V10 also contributed significantly
* SHAP visualizations explain how individual features influence fraud predictions
